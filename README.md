# Detecting confusion state from EEG signals
 In this thesis project, I conducted an experiment and collected EEG brain data from 10 participants to detect the state of confusion. I first processed the EEG data with MATLAB and EEGLAB and then trained machine learning models. I provided the code used to train the learning models and some utility scripts to manipulate the data. The data is not available because it is confidential.
 Note: Here I have practiced programming following the MVC model, using classes, encapsulation, exceptions and cutting my code into several small methods. So the code can look quite lengthy.
 
Achievement:
To predict whether a person is confused or not, the best model scored 78.6%.

To predict the level of confusion (not confused, slightly, moderately and very confused), the best model scored 56.9%.
